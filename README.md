# Arnav Wadalkar 

I‚Äôm an 2nd year undergraduate physics student in **NIT Rourkela** focused on mastering **theoretical and mathematical physics** through a rigorous, structured, and derivation-based approach. My goal is to build a deep, research-capable understanding of core physical theories‚Äîfrom mechanics to field theory and early quantum field theory‚Äîwithout shortcuts or premature abstraction.

## Philosophy  

> "_Understand slowly, but understand completely._"

- Pen-and-paper derivation is my core method.  
- I prioritize physical meaning over symbolic manipulation.  
- I treat mathematical structure as essential, not optional.
